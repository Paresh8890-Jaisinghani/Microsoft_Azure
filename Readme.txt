### Cloud Computing ###
. High availability : provide continues user-exeperience with no apparent-downtime 
. Scalabilty : computing capacity can be increased by adding RAM vertically and horizontally by adding more instances such as more virtual machines
. Elasticity : Different resources at a time
. Agitlity : applications can be deployed quick and changed as requirment changes
. Geo Distribution : applications cna be available across the globe easily
. Disater Recovery : Allow backups , no worries of data lost.

### Cloud service Models ###

### Iaas ## (Infrastructure as a service) a cloud provider will keep the hardware up-to-date, but operating system maintenance and network configuration is up to you as the cloud tenant.
Provides 
1. Data Center
2. Networking firewall 
3. Servers and storage

### Paas ### (Platform as a service) The cloud provider manages the virtual machines and networking resources, and the cloud tenant deploys their applications into the managed hosting environment.
Iaas + 
1.Operating systems
2.Develpoment tools

### Saas ### (software as a service) the cloud provider manages all aspects of the application environment, such as virtual machines, networking resources, data storage, and applications. The cloud tenant only needs to provide their data to the application managed by the cloud provider.
Paas + 
1. Hosted applications




### Deployment Models ###
1. Public Cloud : In a public cloud, services are offered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them. Cloud resources, such as servers and storage are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and delivered over the Internet.

2. Private Cloud : A private cloud consists of computing resources used exclusively by users from one business or organization. A private cloud can be physically located at your organization's on-site or on-premises data center

3. Hybrid Cloud : hybrid cloud computing environments combine a public cloud and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them
